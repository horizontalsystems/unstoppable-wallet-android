/**
 * Per-blockchain extension point. Optional chains implement this and register in
 * [ChainRegistry] at app start; shared code resolves chain-specific behavior through the
 * registry instead of hardcoded `when (blockchainType)` branches, so a consuming app that
 * does not include a chain's module simply has no plugin for it — and no trace of the
 * chain in the UI.
 *
 * Hooks are added incrementally as dispatch points are converted; see
 * docs/Walletkit-Modularization-Plan.md.

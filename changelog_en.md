  Accounts created or restored from a Monero seed phrase are now correctly handled as Monero-only accounts.
  The Bitcoin resend screen now shows a proper error message instead of an empty red block.

  The app now classifies transactions as:
  `created in this wallet`, `from address book contacts`, `received from the blockchain`, and `suspicious (scam)`.

- **Added Monero address rotation for improved security**

- **Added the ability to hide all transactions in the transactions section**
  Works similarly to the tap-to-hide balance behavior.

- **Added clear information when network coins are required for token operations**
  If the user does not have enough native network coins to cover fees, the app now shows this explicitly.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Fixed Jetton swap issue when using Tangem hardware cards**

  When switching between wallets via the `Manage Wallets` menu, ZEC adapters could fail to initialize, and all address types (`Shielded`, `Transparent`, `Unified`) showed the error `Another synchronizer is currently active`.
  As a result, the ZEC wallet did not synchronize after switching accounts.

- **Fixed SQLiteDatabaseCorruptException crash in the Zcash SDK on low-end devices**
  The app could crash with `SQLiteDatabaseCorruptException: database disk image is malformed` while working with a Zcash wallet.
  The failure occurred inside the Zcash SDK while reading transactions from the database, where DB corruption was not handled and the exception was propagated as a fatal crash.

- **Fixed crash when switching between wallets: TooManyRequestsException in ConnectivityManager**
  When switching between wallets repeatedly, the app could crash with `ConnectivityManager$TooManyRequestsException`.
  The cause was exceeding Android's system limit on the number of registered `NetworkCallback` instances per application.

- **Fixed crashes related to Monero wallet operations**

- **Fixed crash when attempting to sign a message via WalletConnect**
  The crash occurred only when an error happened during request processing (for example, when the session was disconnected or expired) and the application attempted to display the error message.

- **Fixed an issue where swapping USDT TRC-20 to Polygon via Quickex was impossible**
  The issue occurred because `finalNetworkFeeAmount` was returned as null.

- **Fixed an issue where USDT Jetton was not syncing (Adapter Unavailable)**

- **Fixed application crashes when working with Monero wallet (libmonerujo.so)**

- **Fixed crash when creating a wallet on low-resource devices**

## 🚀 Version 0.51.17 Update
_Release date: February 22, 2026_

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Fixed an issue when creating the TON adapter**
  For some users, the private key was generated with a length of 31 bytes instead of the required 32 bytes.

  This was caused by the behavior of the BigInteger.toByteArray() method in Java, which may strip leading zero bytes.

  As a result, the following error occurred:
  Invalid private key size, expected: 32, actual: 31

  Private keys are now correctly normalized to 32 bytes during TON adapter creation, preventing wallet initialization errors and ensuring stable TON account operation.

_Release date: February 15, 2026_

### ✨ Improvements

- **Display of actual amount for ChangeNow / Quickex exchanges**
  The transaction history now shows the actual received amount after the exchange is completed instead of the initially quoted one. This ensures accurate accounting in cases where the final amount differs from the expected due to market fluctuations or provider fees.

  Added the ability to clear:
    - network cache;
    - image cache;
    - database cache;

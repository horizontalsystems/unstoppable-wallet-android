Unstoppable wallet engineered to serve the needs of certain people. If you're looking for a plain way to store Bitcoin or some crypto this app might not be for you.

This wallet app is purposely built as a decentralized asset management tool for cryptocurrencies that are immune to inflation, confiscation, or censorship. It packs features designed to onboard investment-oriented individuals into a crypto ecosystem without headaches.

Unstoppable built with following in mind:

If the above rhymes well with you then Unstoppable is for you! And we are here to focus on your unique needs and serve you in the best possible manner.

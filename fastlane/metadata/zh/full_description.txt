Unstoppable wallet is purposely built as a decentralized management tool for cryptocurrencies.

It is engineered to serve privacy-conscious individuals looking to manage and invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in a sovereign and professional manner.

Unstoppable is built with the following in mind:

- Capital Should Be Free >> It’s built to provide users with genuinely independent control over their capital.

- Capital Should Be Borderless >> It works outside the traditional finance layer and acts as a Swiss knife to the world of decentralized finances (DeFi).

- Capital Should Be Private >> It doesn’t leak private data, it has no means to track users, and takes extra measures to ensure privacy on multiple layers.

If the above rhymes well with you then Unstoppable is for you! And we are here to focus on your unique needs and serve you in the best possible manner.

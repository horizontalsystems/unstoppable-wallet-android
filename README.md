# P.CASH Terminal-Wallet

We dream of a world… A world where private property is untouchable and market access is unconditional.

That obsession led us to engineer a crypto wallet that is equally open to all, lives online forever and unconditionally protects your assets.

P.CASH  is a powerful non-custodial multi-wallet for PirateCash, Cosnata, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana and other blockchains. It provides non-custodial crypto and NFT storage, on-chain decentralized swaps, institutional grade analytics for cryptcurrency and NFT markets, extensive privacy controls and human oriented design. 

 - It is built with care and adheres to best programming practices and implementation standards in cryptocurrency world. Fully implemented on Kotlin.
 - It is fully peer-to-peer and works without any centrally managed servers. It can't be stopped, blocked or taken down.

Such approach enables the wallet to operate anywhere and remain censorship-resistant. Only the user is in control of the money.
